![just-the-basics](.github/screenshot.png)

Scrape schools' website and generate better RSS.

## 🤔 How it works?

Application is using credentials from environment variables to login and then session cookie is stored in Redis server.
When someone fetches `/rss.xml`, application uses stored cookie to scrape official website and generate new RSS.
